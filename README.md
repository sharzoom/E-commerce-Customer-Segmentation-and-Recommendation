# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation-and-Recommendation
This project focuses on the strategic implementation of customer segmentation within the realm of e-commerce, employing advanced methodologies such as the K-means clustering algorithm and RFM analysis. Leveraging clustering techniques, including the Elbow, Silhouette methods and gap statistics method we determine the optimal number of clusters for our dataset, unraveling distinct patterns and preferences within our diverse customer base. The K-means clustering visualization provides a graphical representation of customer clusters, aiding in the identification of diverse customer segments with unique characteristics. The application of the Pareto Principle further refines customer segmentation by pinpointing the top revenue generating customers. The nuanced segmentation allows for tailored strategies to address the unique needs of each customer group, facilitating effective approaches to customer engagement and retention.
